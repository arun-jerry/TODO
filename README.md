#### IMPROVEMENTS DONE!
ES6 Object Oriendted code structure.

The edit buttons seems a little misleading to the user. The user won't know if he should click on the edit button to edit it or rather click the text to edit then save the text.


#### SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENTS
* Did not check for duplicated items
* Did not sort the list by time created
* Could have NOT rendered the whole list on every action.

#### Screen 1 : Initial screen
This is preloaded with a task showing as to do and another as completed.
